# Jane√© Mays Professional Portfolio: Portfolio
Personal professional portfolio which includes work samples and relevant skills

## Description 

  I began this project by browsing other professional portfolios to see what I liked and disliked. It was hard for me to make up my mind as I admittedly enjoyed little snipits of several. In the end, I decided to go with a minimalistic palette which focused mostly on my photos. I chose a 30/70 flex layout, specifically targeting the "About Me" portion to the smaller ratio (I found it really hard to talk about myself). Although I found it relatively straight forward to postion the largest image. I struggled with the bottom four images. First, I could not get them to display in a grid format. Next, when I added a border, I notice white space around the right and bottom sides of the images.
